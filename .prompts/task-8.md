## TASK: Remove Duplicate Gallery from Agent Mode Template

### Context:
The Agent Mode template currently displays two galleries:
- One from the helper (KEEP this one)
- One hardcoded block (`property-gallery-direct`) in `agent-template.php` (REMOVE this one)

We only need the helper-based gallery implementation.

---

### Requirements:
1. **File**: `includes/Views/agent-template.php`
2. Remove the entire `<section class="property-gallery-direct">...</section>` block.
3. Ensure no other duplicate gallery code remains.
4. Do NOT modify helper logic; only keep the helper-based gallery.
5. Maintain all other existing sections (price, property details, additional details, video, etc.).
6. Remove any debug output related to gallery extraction.
7. Create a log file in `/logs/`:
   - Name: `YYYY-MM-DD_remove-duplicate-gallery.md`
   - Include:
     - Summary of removal
     - Files modified
     - Confirmation that only the helper gallery remains

---

### Testing:
- Load an Agent Mode view for a property with gallery images.
- Confirm **only one gallery** displays.
- Check that layout and styling remain intact.
- Ensure debug blocks are removed from output.
