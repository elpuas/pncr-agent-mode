  "context": "PBCR Agent Mode template",
  "objective": "Remove the featured image section entirely and replace the gallery grid with a Swiper slider using gallery_urls as the sole image source. Maintain the clean, modern look of the current grid but enhance it with interactive slider navigation and thumbnails.",

    "remove": [
      "The entire <div class='property-image'> block that displays the featured image"

      "target": "property-gallery",

      "source": "Use only $property_data['gallery_urls']",
      "fallback": "No fallback to gallery_ids needed; this block is meant for enhanced modern display only"
    },
    "requirements": {
      "1": "Swiper styles and JS must be enqueued in agent-mode.php",
      "2": "Slider must be keyboard accessible and use semantic <img> with alt",
      "3": "Main image slider shows large image with no zoom or modal for now",
      "4": "Thumbnails below act as navigation; highlight active slide",
      "5": "Mobile responsive: use vertical scrolling thumbs below slider if needed",
      "6": "CSS must be scoped with .agent-mode or similar custom classes (no RealHomes)"
    },
    "output": {
      "php_template": "Replace .gallery-grid with a Swiper-friendly structure using gallery_urls",
      "js_init": "Add Swiper slider init script to agent-mode.js or inline if isolated",
      "css": "Minimal CSS for layout and thumbnail styling, scoped to avoid theme conflicts"
    },
    "notes": "No branding or dependency. Keep markup clean and portable. No Limit to images, adjust Layout accordingly."
