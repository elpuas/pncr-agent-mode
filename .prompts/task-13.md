Analyze and Fix Autoloading Namespace Mismatch

⸻

Context:
	•	The plugin uses PSR-4 autoloading for namespaces.
	•	The error in production:

Class "PBCRAgentMode\Blocks\AgentCopyButton" not found


	•	Local works, production fails → likely due to case-sensitive file system issue.
	•	Namespace declared in code: PBCRAgentMode\Blocks.
	•	The autoloader expects folder includes/Blocks/, but current folder might be lowercase blocks.

⸻

Steps for the Agent

1. Analyze Current State
	•	Check:
	•	Does the folder exist as includes/Blocks/ or includes/blocks/?
	•	Does the file AgentCopyButton.php exist? If yes, confirm namespace matches PBCRAgentMode\Blocks.
	•	Review composer.json autoload section for PSR-4 mapping.

2. Identify Issue
	•	If the namespace and folder name differ in case, this is the root cause.
	•	If the file is missing, log the issue and STOP (do not guess the file content).

3. Fix with Safety
	•	If only the case is wrong:
	•	Prepare a plan to rename the folder from lowercase to PascalCase (Blocks).
	•	Before renaming, STOP and ask for confirmation (do NOT auto-delete or overwrite).
	•	Update any references in the code if needed (should not be necessary if autoloading is consistent).

4. Validate
	•	After fix, regenerate Composer autoload files:

composer dump-autoload


	•	Confirm:
	•	No more Class not found error.
	•	Plugin loads correctly.

5. Document
	•	Create log file in /logs/:
	•	Name: YYYY-MM-DD_namespace-fix.md.
	•	Include:
	•	Root cause.
	•	Action taken (folder rename, file validation).
	•	Testing steps to confirm the fix.

⸻

Rules
	•	DO NOT remove unrelated files.
	•	DO NOT create new classes unless explicitly instructed.
	•	If unsure about file creation or deletion, STOP and request user confirmation.

⸻

✅ Expected Output from Agent:
	•	Analysis report (current folder structure, namespace, PSR-4 config).
	•	Confirmation request before any rename or file move.
	•	Updated autoload and logs after approval.
