# 2024-12-19 â€“ Task: Plugin Scaffold Implementation

## Summary

- Implemented the complete directory structure and scaffolding for the PBCR Agent Mode WordPress plugin.
- Created all required PHP classes following OOP structure with proper namespacing (PBCRAgentMode\).
- Implemented the main plugin bootstrap file with security checks, autoloader, and activation/deactivation hooks.
- Created the Plugin class with template system integration for agent mode views.
- Built the Loader class for registering shortcodes and enqueueing assets.
- Developed the AgentViewLink shortcode class with [agent_view_link] functionality.
- Created the agent template view with minimal, unbranded property display structure.
- Implemented scoped CSS following modern vanilla CSS guidelines with container queries and CSS Grid.
- Added proper security measures (ABSPATH checks, escaping, sanitization).
- Set up logging infrastructure with this initial log file.

## Files Created

- `pbcr-agent-mode.php` - Main plugin bootstrap file
- `includes/Plugin.php` - Main plugin class
- `includes/Loader.php` - Component loader class  
- `includes/Shortcodes/AgentViewLink.php` - Shortcode for generating agent view URLs
- `includes/Views/agent-template.php` - Minimal agent view template
- `includes/Css/agent-style.css` - Scoped plugin styles
- `logs/2024-12-19_plugin-scaffold.md` - This log file

## Technical Implementation Details

- Used PSR-4 autoloading structure with custom autoloader function
- Implemented WordPress hooks for template_include and query_vars
- Added agent_view query parameter for URL handling
- Created responsive CSS grid layout with mobile-first approach
- Included modern CSS features (container queries, :has(), :not() selectors)
- Followed WordPress coding standards for PHP 8+
- Applied proper escaping and sanitization for all dynamic output

## Known Issues or Follow-ups Required

- Property price and location data extraction needs implementation based on RealHomes theme structure
- Contact button functionality needs configuration (WhatsApp/email integration)
- Rewrite rules implementation for cleaner URLs (optional enhancement)
- Property meta field mapping needs to be determined
- Testing with actual RealHomes property data required

## Time Spent

Approximately 2 hours for complete scaffold implementation and documentation.

## Next Steps

1. Investigate RealHomes theme property meta structure
2. Implement property data extraction (price, location, etc.)
3. Test plugin activation and shortcode functionality
4. Configure contact button with actual agent information
5. Test responsive design on various devices
