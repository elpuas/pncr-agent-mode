# 2025-01-05 â€“ Task: Migrate Cursor Rules to GitHub Copilot Instructions

## Summary

- Successfully migrated all project-specific rules and development standards from `.cursor/rules` folder to GitHub Copilot compatible format
- Created comprehensive `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file covering all aspects of the plugin development
- Extracted and organized rules from `project-plan.mdc` and `agent-rules.mdc` into structured Copilot instructions
- Maintained all critical development standards including PHP 8+, modern CSS, OOP architecture, and security requirements
- Preserved mandatory logging requirements and folder structure specifications
- Ensured continuity of development standards for VS Code with GitHub Copilot environment

## Technical Implementation Details

### Source Files Analyzed

- `.cursor/rules/project-plan.mdc` - Project overview, requirements, and deliverables
- `.cursor/rules/agent-rules.mdc` - Technical rules, coding standards, and architecture guidelines
- `logs/2024-12-19_plugin-scaffold.md` - Previous implementation details
- `logs/2024-12-19_css-refactor.md` - CSS modernization specifics

### Content Organization

Structured the Copilot instructions into logical sections:

1. **Goal** - Clear project purpose and context
2. **Coding Standards** - PHP, CSS, and JavaScript specific rules
3. **Plugin Architecture** - OOP structure and core principles
4. **Folder Structure** - Complete directory layout
5. **Agent View Requirements** - Functional specifications
6. **AI Expectations** - Development guidelines for AI assistance
7. **Mandatory Logging** - Log format and requirements
8. **Development Workflow** - Step-by-step process
9. **Restrictions** - Clear limitations and constraints

### Key Standards Preserved

- PHP 8+ syntax with WordPress coding standards
- Modern vanilla CSS with container queries and scoping
- OOP architecture with PSR-4 autoloading
- Security-first approach with proper escaping
- Mobile-optimized responsive design
- Independence from RealHomes theme
- Mandatory logging after each task

## Migration Benefits

- **VS Code Compatibility**: Instructions now work with GitHub Copilot in VS Code
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: All original rules maintained and expanded
- **Better Organization**: Clearer structure for AI consumption
- **Development Continuity**: No loss of project standards or requirements
- **Enhanced Guidance**: More detailed AI expectations and workflow steps

## Files Created

- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` - Complete GitHub Copilot instructions file
- `logs/2025-01-05_cursor-rules-migration.md` - This log file

## Known Issues or Follow-ups Required

- Original `.cursor/rules` folder can now be removed since rules are migrated
- Team members need to be informed about the switch from Cursor to VS Code + GitHub Copilot
- May need to verify Copilot properly reads the instructions during development

## Time Spent

Approximately 1 hour for analysis, migration, and documentation

## Next Steps

1. Test GitHub Copilot integration with the new instructions
2. Remove old `.cursor/rules` folder if migration is confirmed successful
3. Update any team documentation about development environment changes
