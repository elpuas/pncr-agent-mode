# Project Plan – Agent Mode Plugin (Property Sharing, No Branding)

## Overview

This project requires the development of a custom WordPress plugin that enables a "Broker Mode" or "Agent Mode" feature. It will allow agents to share individual property listings via a unique URL, which renders a minimal, unbranded view of the property. The implementation must be fully compatible with the **RealHomes Theme (Version 4.4.1)** but operate entirely independently from the theme’s templates, styles, and assets.

---

## Purpose

Enable agents to share specific properties without exposing the company’s brand, layout, or global elements. The link must load only the property information in a neutral, minimal layout optimized for mobile and direct client interaction.

---

## Requirements

### Functional

- Each property must be accessible via a unique, shareable URL.
- The shared view must exclude all theme branding:
  - No logo
  - No navigation/menu
  - No header/footer
  - No theme styles or scripts
- The shared page must include:
  - Property title
  - Featured image or gallery
  - Price
  - Location
  - Description
  - Contact button (e.g., WhatsApp link or mailto link)
- The layout must be fully responsive and load quickly on mobile devices.

### Technical

- The plugin must be structured as a **standalone WordPress plugin**, not a theme child or extension.
- Must register a custom rewrite endpoint or use a query string such as `?agent_view=1`.
- Must hook into `template_include` to load a custom PHP template for the agent view.
- Must retrieve property data using `WP_Query`, not rely on RealHomes theme functions.
- All plugin styles must be scoped, minimal, and enqueued separately (`wp_enqueue_style`).
- Must verify that the property exists and is published.
- The page must return a `404` if the property does not exist or is unpublished.
- Must not expose private metadata or fields not intended for frontend viewing.
- Must not require login or authentication to access the agent view.
- Must not use JavaScript frameworks. Use plain PHP and minimal JavaScript only where necessary.
- Must not depend on external libraries or CDNs.

---

## Deliverables

- WordPress plugin directory: `agent-mode`
- Plugin files:
  - `agent-mode.php` (main bootstrap file)
  - `includes/template-agent-mode.php` (template override)
  - `css/agent-style.css` (scoped layout styles)
- Rewrite or query handler
- Template rendering logic using native WordPress functions
- Sanitization and escaping for all dynamic output
- Final `README.md` with usage instructions

---

## Editor Integration – Shortcode for Agent View Link

The plugin must include a shortcode `[agent_view_link]` that outputs a fully qualified URL to the current property’s Agent Mode view.

### Requirements

- The shortcode must be available for use **within the property editor** (classic editor or block editor).
- The output must be a **full URL**, including site domain and property identifier.
- The shortcode must only work when used within a single property context (`post_type = property`).
- The plugin must register the shortcode via `add_shortcode`.
- If the shortcode is used outside a property context, it must return nothing.

### Output Example

When used inside a property with ID `12345`:

## Final Notes

This plugin is purpose-built for the Agent Mode functionality and will not interfere with existing RealHomes theme features. It provides a neutral and controlled environment for property sharing by third-party agents or brokers without brand exposure.
